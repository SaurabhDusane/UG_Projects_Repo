# Basic Customer Chatbot 🤖

A simple yet interactive customer service chatbot built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was developed as part of my undergraduate studies to demonstrate fundamental web development skills and basic chatbot functionality.

## 📋 Project Overview

This chatbot simulates a customer service experience for an e-commerce platform called "ShopBot." It provides automated responses to common customer inquiries and can redirect users to relevant web pages.

### ⚠️ Project Limitations

This is a **basic educational project** with extremely limited capabilities:
- Uses simple keyword matching (no real AI/ML)
- Static response database
- No backend integration
- No persistent data storage
- Limited conversation flow
- Predefined responses only

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Modern, responsive design with smooth animations
- **Keyword Recognition**: Basic pattern matching for user intent detection
- **Order Tracking Simulation**: Mock order lookup with sample data
- **Website Redirection**: Interactive buttons that redirect to external pages
- **Quick Reply Options**: Pre-defined response buttons for common queries
- **Typing Indicators**: Visual feedback during response generation
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure and content
- **CSS3**: Styling, animations, and responsive design
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Logic, DOM manipulation, and interactivity
- **No external libraries or frameworks**
